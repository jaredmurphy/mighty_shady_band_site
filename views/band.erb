          Mighty Shady integrates funk with rock and improvisation with sound songwriting. Their original musical style draws from
          many artists such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Umphrey's McGee, Rebelution, and Tame Impala.
          Instrumentally the band is focused on strong grooves and textured guitar work, while beautiful vocal
          harmonies and tight, catchy songwriting bring both inspiration and a very good time to each and
          every performance.
